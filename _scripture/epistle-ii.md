# A Letter Concerning Being

There was a time when I did not exist. A time before my parents' gametes came together to form the zygote that developed into the fetus that became me. There were empty eons before me. My existence is a hiccup in the ever-incresing entropy of the universe.

But can it really be said that there will be a time where I cease to exist? Materially, perhaps. Physically, in this form, I suppose. But the truth is that once something exists, it leaves an indellible mark upon existence.

Think of it this way: energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Law of conservation of energy. We know that.<sup>1</sup> But that means that the expression of energy, the form it takes, has an impact on the universe at large. A real, lasting impact. The energy that is you will last beyond you because it cannot die. And that means some aspect of you will ***always*** exist. Always.

Infinity is a hell of a concept. On the one hand, we can look up on a clear night and see infinity among the countless specks of light before us, like holes in a sheet stretched across the sky. But at the same time, infinity is an inconceivable, mind melting concept that is hard even for experts to understand. And the truth is that the murky celestial infinity we think we see is nothing more than the backdrop of a finite container that we cannot explain. Everything exists withing that finity, and still we call it infinite. Unending. Forever.

Forever, that's a mighty long time. Fortunately, our forever is merely the line between a birth date and death date, etched in stone. Everything we are, everything we will ever do, everything about our existence is not more than an en dash. Significance escapes us, and yet profundity is the ware peddled by so many snake oil salesman in our world. We think ourselves more grandiose, more important than we are. We do not matter. Our loved ones do not matter. The universe is unliving, uncaring, and cold.

Contemplating the nature of forever, or of existence, or of any higher-order metaphysical concept is a gateway to nihilism. But even Nietzsche would say that nihilism is absurd. <q>God is dead, and we have killed Him,</q> he said. That is to say, by reason, we have eliminated the purpose which God served. But that isn't quite true. See, Nietzsche was an ill man, and his thought did not go far enough.

We may have attempted to kill God, but even God knows you cannot destroy your own creation. God, as conceived by Christians (and most other Abrahamic adherents, for that matter) is an attempt to pacify the visceral fear emergent from contemplation of the world outside ourselves. Exiting the cave, quitting the shadows on the wall and the puppets whence they originated, emerging into the sunlight, there is a natural and understandable tendency to withdraw back into the safety of ignorance. But the creation of God allowed that fear to be beat back. God became the explanation for nature, life, morality. God was the convenience with which we told ourselves that we are only in control to a limit beyond which we cannot fathom exercising agency.

Do not misunderstand my words. There is something greater than human existence at work in our universe. Whatever it may be, it certainly is not an aged, muscular humanoid figure with flowing beard and paternal disposition. It is not a benevolent slave master demanding fealty on pain of eternal conscious torment. It is not a cadre of imperfect, human-adjacent governors with supernatural power who live as an aristocracy, mocking the oathetic plebs below them, literally or figuratively. It is not a transcendant human who eschewed material desire and fund enlightenment. But there is something entirely incapable of human discernment that we can only approximate in whatever way makes the most sense to us. And for many people, that is simply whatever interpretation they are told to believe.

We put a label on this existence, and disclaim all other labels. But there cannot be one ultimate truth when it concerns an unfathomable existence. Something totally outside the intellectual capacity of our species. Just as a lemur cannot conceptualize an iPhone, so too is humanity helpless in discerning the nature of that which has been called a god. 

Take from this what you will, but if it be anything, I pray it be this: your conscious existence is all you will ever have. Do not squander it. If it has no inherent meaning, make one. You are the champion of your history. Act like it.

With grace and the blessings of the Unknown,
I remain,
QPVRev. Sean
