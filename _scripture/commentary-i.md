Faith without works is dead.

There is a truth that we all must face when it comes to our faith: there is belief, and there is action. You can have one without the other, but each is meaningless on its own. Belief without action is empty. Action without belief is pageantry. In order to live in fullness of faith, you must have both.

The performative nature of action makes it an identity marker. It signals to others that you are a member of some in-group, but nothing more. It can lead others to assume you do everything members do, but that isn't necessarily the case. You have to have an understanding and a belief underlying that action for it to be meaningful. Similarly, if you have belief but do not take positive action in furtherance of it, what purpose is the belief serving? We are told in the Letter to James, chapter 2, at 14-17:

><sup>[14]</sup> What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Surely that faith cannot save, can it? <sup>[15]</sup> If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food <sup>[16]</sup> and one of you says to them "Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill," and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? <sup>[17]</sup> So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.

Further, in verses 21-23, it is written:

><sup>[21]</sup> Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? <sup>[22]</sup> You see that faith was active along with his works, and by works faith was brought to completion. <sup>[23]</sup> Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness," and he was called the friend of God.

Friends, it is made clear in this Letter that, throughout the Bible, time and again, faith and works walk hand in hand, proving that one without the other is irredeemable.
